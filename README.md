# CSE224 Spring 2025 - ASIC Design Projects  
This repository contains three OpenLane-based ASIC design projects completed as part of the CSE224 course during Spring 2025.

## 🧠 Overview of Projects

### 📁 `project1_openlane/twos_complement`
Design of a Two's Complement logic block. The module converts binary input into its two's complement form.  
This design was previously uploaded in archived `.tar.gz` format, which remains in the repository as a historical reference. The current folder structure was later pushed for visual clarity and consistency across all projects.

### 📁 `project2_openlane/alu`
Implements a simple Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). It includes basic operations such as addition, subtraction, and bitwise logic, synthesized and implemented using the OpenLane toolchain.

### 📁 `project3_openlane/seven_seg_counter`
A counter module from 0 to 5, with its binary output decoded and displayed using a 7-segment display module. This project demonstrates hierarchical Verilog design and ASIC synthesis via OpenLane.

## 📦 Archive Note
> **Note:** The `twos_complement_project.tar.gz` file corresponds to Project 1 and was uploaded earlier. Its presence is retained intentionally as a backup.  
The folder `project1_openlane/twos_complement/` reflects the same design, structured to match the format of later projects.

> Both students equally contributed to all three projects.  
Project 1 was initially uploaded in archived format (`.tar.gz`), and the structured folder version was added later for clarity and consistency.
